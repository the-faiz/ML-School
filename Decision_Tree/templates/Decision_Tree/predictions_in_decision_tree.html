                    In our <a href="../../../Decision_Tree/overview.html">previous discussion </a>we have seen a brief overview on how a decision tree is created by choosing and splitting a
                    variable. Before we look into the details of how a variable is chosen and split thresholds are selected, first letâ€™s look
                    at how the decision tree makes predictions for given data points.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Predictions in Classification Tree </h4>
                For classification trees we can count how many
                data points belong to the positive and negative class.
                We can output probability for the positive class by dividing the count of positive class data points by total count in
                the region. 
                Below is the classification decision tree which we have seen in the 
                <a href="../../../Decision_Tree/overview.html">previous discussion </a>.
                {% load static %}
                <div class="my-4">
                    <img src={% static 'Decision_Tree/decision_tree_overview.png' %} class="img-fluid rounded float-centre" alt="decision tree">
                </div>

                There are three regions in this Tree. <br>
                <b> Region 1</b> <br>
                Count of default = 10 <br>
                Count of non default =  1 <br>
                Total count = 11 <br>
                Predicted probability for default =  10/11 = 0.909 <br> 
                This region has a very high probability for default class. <br>
        
                <b> Region 3</b> <br>
                Count of default = 4 <br>
                Count of non default =  0 <br>
                Total count = 4 <br>
                Predicted probability for default =  4/4 = 1 <br> 
                This region has a very high probability for default class. <br>
                <b> Region 2</b> <br>
                Count of default = 2 <br>
                Count of non default =  15 <br>
                Total count = 17 <br>
                Predicted probability for default =  2/17 = 0.117 <br> 
                This region has a very low probability for default class. <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                <h4> Predictions in Regression Tree</h4>
                We can calculate the average value of all the data points present in the region. This value is considered as the
                predicted value for the region.
