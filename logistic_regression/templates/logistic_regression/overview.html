            Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for classification problems. Classification
            problems have discrete types of dependent variables. For example Email spam classification where y=1 denotes an email is
            spam while y=0 denotes it is not a sapam. Similarly we have credit default prediction problems. In this case y=1 denotes
            customer defaulted on credit while y=0 denotes customer did not default on credit. Both examples have binary dependent
            variables, there can be multiple classes associated with dependent variables but for now we will look at binary labels
            only. <br>
            
            Letâ€™s dig deeper into the credit default problem. We will have historical data of the customers such as income, Credit
            utilisation etc. We will also have a dependent variable \( y \) which will have two levels \(y=1\) which means customer has
            defaulted and \(y=0\) which means customer has not defaulted. Below table shows a few data points.

                Below plot shows the class of each data point and credit utilisation. You can clearly see if an individual is using
                higher credit then it is likely to default on the credit. <br>
                
                Logistic Regression fits the sigmoid curve in the data and classifies each of the data points to their respective class.
                Logistic Regression does not output class directly rather it gives a probability score. Red curve in the plot shows the
                sigmoid value corresponding to each of the data points ( just hover the mouse over the curve). Once we fit the sigmoid
                curve in the data we can choose a threshold and classify each of the data points to its respective class. In this case
                we can say if the sigmoid value is >= 0.5 then mark it as a positive class otherwise negative class.

            <p>
                Logistic regression tries to fit sigmoid curve in the data and generates a probability score for each of the data 
                point. In the next chapter let's understand more about sigmoid curve.
